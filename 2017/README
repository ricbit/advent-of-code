Time: 03:55 06:17

Algo: string manipulation

## Fails

- Deducing problem just from the inputs failed. I thought I had to group the values, but actually it was just comparison to neighbour. Also didn't notice the list was circular.
  - FIX: Better reading
- Lots of typos.
  - FIX: Turn off autocomplete, didn't like it.
- Groupby second argument is iterator, not a list.
  - FIX: Memorize
- Too much time typing out the python cmd.
  - FIX: Write script
- Samples were presented inline in the text.
  - FIX: Should have a script for that.
- Too much time clicking on timer.
  - FIX: Stop timer with script.
- Manual copying from p1 into p2.
  - FIX: Script do it automatically but it is too slow. Custom script.
- Vim took too much time to open (1s)
  - FIX: Maybe it gets faster without loading autocomplete.

## Wins

- Script worked. (Remember to have only one chrome window open)
- Timer worked.
- Auto clipboard worked.
- Auto open of input was a big win (to check if the input length was even).
