# Advent of Code 2019, personal rules

- The objective is to get the answer as fast as possible.
  - I code in mostly in python because it's the fastest language I can type.
  - *Almost* anything goes. It's ok to: use numpy, sympy, networkx, graphviz, edit the input, use Mathematica, C++, CUDA, custom vim scripts, custom tmux scripts, custom python libs, chrome extensions, short variable names, copy and paste, pypy3.
  - It's *forbidden* to: use AI or look up the answer.
  - Once started, you have to finish. If a pause is needed, the clock countinues ticking.

- Once the problem is solved:
  - Refactor the problem to make it legible.
  - Make it run under 1s if possible.
